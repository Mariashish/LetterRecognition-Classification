# Letter Recognition Classification

### The individual research project focused on Data Mining & Analytics, specifically exploring Classification Models for Letter Recognition using the "Letter Recognition" dataset. The dataset consisted of 20,000 images of English uppercase letters from 20 different fonts, each described by 17 attributes, including the letter category (A-Z).

### The first classifier applied was the Random Forest algorithm, achieving an impressive overall accuracy of 96.38%. This ensemble method effectively addressed overfitting through bagging and attribute selection, resulting in high sensitivity for most letter classes.

### The second classifier utilized was the Support Vector Machine (SVM), achieving an overall accuracy of 85.62%. SVM, known for handling non-linear relationships, demonstrated strength in recognizing various letters, confirming its robustness.

### The third classifier employed was the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, which achieved an accuracy of 94.98%. KNN's logic, based on data proximity, led to excellent results, with high sensitivity for many letter classes.

### In conclusion, each classifier demonstrated specific strengths, with Random Forest excelling in overfitting management, SVM handling non-linear relationships effectively, and KNN leveraging data proximity. Overall, all three classifiers proved robust and reliable for letter classification in this context, surpassing the 80% accuracy benchmark set by the dataset's creator.
